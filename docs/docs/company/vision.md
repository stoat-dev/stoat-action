# Vision

Stoat aims to be the "**s**martest **t**ool **o**f **a**ll **t**ime" and the platform for developer tooling.

As a first step, we're building a customizable dashboard for developers. Our initial focus is on three key areas:
1. Simplifying access to build outputs and reports
2. Highlighting metrics in the development process
3. Streamlining the management of build jobs and tracking their progress (e.g. integration tests)

Longer term, our goal is to make it trivial to help engineers iterate quickly, keep focused on KPIs, safely launch workflows, and develop interfaces with other teams.
We are starting out as "Retool for GitHub" but have big plans for the future. 
Join us on our journey to revolutionize the world of developer tools.
