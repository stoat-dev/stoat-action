# Get Started

:::caution

We currently only recommend using Stoat for **public repos**!

[Paid authentication](company/pricing) for private repos is on our [roadmap](company/roadmap). Until it's released,
all files, all metrics, and all other data you publish to Stoat for templating will be publicly accessible!

:::

## 1. Install GitHub Application

Go to the [Stoat GitHub application page](https://github.com/apps/stoat-app/) and install the application for your repository.

The application requires the following permissions:

| Entity | Permission | Reason |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| User emails | **Read** | Necessary for user identification and authentication. |
| Metadata | **Read** | Enabled by default. |
| Actions | **Read** | Currently not used. Necessary to read GitHub job logs. |
| Pull requests | **Write** | Necessary to create and update comments in pull requests. |

If you have any questions or concerns about the permissions, or run into any problems, please [let us know](company/contact-us).

## 2. Install CLI

Requirements:
- Node/NPM
- Mac/Linux

To install, run:
```
npm i -g stoat
```

## 3. Initialize Stoat for a Git Repository

To initialize a Stoat project within a Git repository, run:
```
stoat init
```

The initialization command will create a configuration file for Stoat at `.stoat/config.yaml` 
and will give you the option to add the Stoat GitHub action as the final step in all GitHub jobs.

## 4. Configure Stoat

To start pushing data to Stoat, you will need to add additional configuration.

We have comprehensive examples and guides for different types of users:
