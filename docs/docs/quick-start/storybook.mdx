# Storybook

Follow these steps to generate Storybook previews for each pull request.

1. Install the [Stoat App](https://github.com/apps/stoat-app).

2. Append the [Stoat Action](https://github.com/stoat-dev/stoat-action) at the end of the GitHub workflow that generates a Storybook build. For example:

    ```yaml title=".github/workflows/storybook.yaml"
    # existing step in your repo that generates a static Storybook build
    - name: Build Storybook
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build-storybook

    - name: Run Stoat Action
      uses: stoat-dev/stoat-action@v0
      if: always()
    ```

3. Create a `.stoat` directory and add a Stoat config file `config.yaml`:

    ```yaml title=".stoat/config.yaml"
    ---
    version: 1
    enabled: true
    tasks:
      storybook:
        metadata:
          # an arbitrary name for the Storybook task
          name: "Storybook"
        static_hosting:
          # path to the Storybook build
          path: storybook-static
    ```

    By default, the `build-storybook` script will generate a static Storybook in the `storybook-static` directory (documentation [here](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/deploy)). This is the directory to set for the `path` field in the Stoat config file. It should be adjusted according to your configuration.

That's it. Now, every time you open a pull request, Stoat will host the Storybook build and post a comment with a link to the preview. See an example in [this pull request](https://github.com/stoat-dev/examples/pull/1).
