# Track build runtimes in every PR

The job runtime plugin automatically collects build times for every GitHub job and graphs them in the Stoat comment.
Each line in the plot represents the runtime of a different workflow job across all the commits in the pull request.
The x-axis is the short commit SHA, and the y-axis is the runtime in seconds.
In the future, you will be able to compare the build runtime with your default branch in the same graph.

## How to enable tracking build runtimes

1. Set up Stoat with our [getting started guide](../installation).

2. Make sure the [Stoat Action](https://github.com/stoat-dev/stoat-action) appears at the end of each GitHub workflow job that you want to collect the runtime for:
    ```yaml title=".github/workflows/hello-world.yaml"
    name: Hello World

    on:
      push:

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v3

          # Append the stoat action at the end of each job you want to collect runtime for.
          - name: Run Stoat Action
            uses: stoat-dev/stoat-action@v0
            if: always()
    ```

3. To enable tracking build runtimes, add a new task for the `job_runtime` plugin in your `.stoat/config.yaml` file:
    ```yaml title=".stoat/config.yaml"
    ---
    version: 1
    enabled: true
    tasks:
      # name of the job runtime task
      build-time-history:
        # set this key to select the job_runtime plugin
        job_runtime:
    ```

4. That's it. Next time you create a pull request, you should see a line plot of action runtimes in the pinned comment.
