# Job Runtime

The job runtime plugin automatically collect runtime for every GitHub action, and present them in the pinned comment in pull requests.

To enable this plugin, add a new task with the `job_runtime` plugin in your `.stoat/config.yaml` file:

```yaml title=".stoat/config.yaml"
---
version: 1
enabled: true
tasks:
  # Add a task with any arbitrary name.
  build-time-history:
    # The task should have the job runtime plugin.
    job_runtime:
```

Then append the `stoat-dev/stoat-action` to any GitHub action that you want to collect runtime for:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/hello-world.yaml"
name: Hello World

on:
  push:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Append the stoat action at the end of each job you want to collect runtime for.
      - name: Run Stoat Action
        uses: stoat-dev/stoat-action@v0
        if: always()
```

That's it. Next time when you create a pull request, you should see a line plot of action runtimes in the pinned comment. For example:

<img width="523" alt="job runtime chart" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1933157/206887357-257a39a5-27b5-4542-bf69-26c71f06522d.png" />

Each line in the plot represents the runtime of a different workflow job across all the commits in the pull request. The x-axis is the short commit SHA, and the y-axis is the runtime in seconds.
