# Preview UI components in PRs

Stoat can help you preview UI components from a link in a comment on your pull requests. In this tutorial we will
use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as an example for component previews, but Stoat can also be used with
[Ladle](https://ladle.dev/) or other similar tools.

Here's an example of a Stoat comment with a link to a hosted Storybook generated by the latest build:
<img src={require('../../static/img/screenshot-storybook.png').default} alt="storybook comment screenshot" width={600} />

## Adding component previews to the Stoat comment

1. Set up Stoat with our [getting started guide](../installation).

2. Make sure the [Stoat Action](https://github.com/stoat-dev/stoat-action) appears after the GitHub workflow step
   that builds your static component preview site.

    ```yaml title=".github/workflows/storybook.yaml"
    # existing step in your repo that generates a static Storybook build
    - name: Build Storybook
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build-storybook

   - name: Run Stoat Action
      uses: stoat-dev/stoat-action@v0
      if: always()
   ```

3. Point Stoat at the generated static site's path by adding a new task that uses the `static_hosting` plugin:

     ```yaml title=".stoat/config.yaml"
     ---
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     tasks:
       # unique task id for your Storybook preview
       storybook:
         metadata:
           # the display name for your Storybook preview
           name: "Storybook"
         static_hosting:
           # path to the Storybook build output
           path: storybook-static
    ```

By default, the `npm run build-storybook` will generate a static Storybook in the `storybook-static` directory (documentation [here](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/deploy)).
If you configure a custom output directory, are building Storybook from a subdirectory of a Git repository, or if you are using a different component preview tool, you will need to update the path.

That's it! Now, every time you open a pull request, Stoat will host the Storybook build outputs and link to the preview in the Stoat comment.

## Example Repo

See a real build that generates and links to a Storybook preview in [this pull request](https://github.com/stoat-dev/examples/pull/1).
