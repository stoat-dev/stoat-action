# Preview documentation in PRs

Stoat can help you preview static docs pages generated as part of your build in a comment on your pull request.

Here's an example of a Stoat comment that links to a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) site generated by the latest build:
<img src="https://stoat-dev--static.stoat.page/screenshot-documentation.png" alt="docusaurus comment screenshot" width={400} />

## Supported Docs Pages
* Static Documentation Sites ([Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/), [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), etc.)
* API Docs ([Swagger](https://swagger.io/), [ReDoc](https://redocly.com/), etc.)
* Code Docs ([Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc), [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html), [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/), etc.)
* ...and any other static docs websites!

## Example Repo

See a real build that generates a Docusaurus site and links to it in a Stoat comment in [this pull request](https://github.com/stoat-dev/stoat-action/pull/12).

# Adding documentation previews to the Stoat comment

In this tutorial we will show how to add a Docusaurus static preview to the Stoat comment, but the same approach applies for any static HTML documentation produced by your build.

1. Set up Stoat with our [getting started guide](../installation).

2. Make sure the [Stoat Action](https://github.com/stoat-dev/stoat-action) appears after the GitHub workflow step that generates your Docusaurus build output.

    ```yaml title=".github/workflows/docs.yaml"
    # existing step in your repo that generates a static Docusaurus build
    - name: Build Docusaurus
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build

    - name: Run Stoat Action
      uses: stoat-dev/stoat-action@v0
      if: always()
    ```

3. Point Stoat at the generated Docusaurus static build by adding a new task that uses the `static_hosting` plugin:

    ```yaml title=".stoat/config.yaml"
    ---
    version: 1
    enabled: true
    tasks:
      docusaurus:
        metadata:
          # a name for the Docusaurus task
          name: "Documentation"
        static_hosting:
          # path to the Docusaurus build
          path: build
    ```

   By default, `npm run build` will generate static Docusaurus pages in the `build` directory (documentation [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)).
   This is the directory to set for the `path` field in the Stoat config file.
   If Docusaurus is built in a subdirectory of the Git repository or if you're using a different docs tool, the path will be different.

4. That's it! Now, every time you open a pull request, Stoat will host the Docusaurus build and post a comment with a link to the preview. See an example in [this pull request](https://github.com/stoat-dev/stoat-action/pull/12).
