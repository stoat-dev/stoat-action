# View Kubernetes Logs in PRs

Stoat can help you easily view and access logs for Kubernetes clusters in your GitHub workflows from a comment on your pull request.

Here's an example of a Stoat comment that links to an interactive log viewer for Kubernetes:

## Example Repo

See a real build that links to a log viewer for Kubernetes logs [this pull request](https://github.com/stoat-dev/kubernetes-log-export-action/pull/1).

# Adding Kubernetes log previews to the Stoat comment

In this tutorial we will show how to add a Kubernetes log preview to the Stoat comment.

1. Set up Stoat with our [getting started guide](../installation).

2. Add both an action to dump logs to some directory using `stoat-dev/kubernetes-log-export-action@v1` the [Stoat Action](https://github.com/stoat-dev/stoat-action) to upload the log outputs to Stoat.

    ```yaml title=".github/workflows/kubernetes.yaml"
     # ... cluster initialization ...

     # ... tests that run on Kubernetes ...

     - name: Dump Kubernetes Logs
       if: always()
       uses: stoat-dev/kubernetes-log-export-action@v1
       with:
         namespaces: default,kube-system
         show_timestamps: 'true'
         output_dir: kube-logs-output

     - name: Run Stoat Action
       uses: stoat-dev/stoat-action@v0
       if: always()
    ```

    Note that if you don't include `if: always()` the results will not be captured on test failure.

3. Point Stoat at the generated logs by adding a new task that uses the `static_hosting` plugin:

    ```yaml title=".stoat/config.yaml"
     ---
     version: 1
     enabled: true
     plugins:
       static_hosting:
         kube_logs:
           metadata:
             name: "Kubernetes Logs"
           path: kube-logs-output
           file_viewer: true
    ```

    Note that this uses the `file_viewer: true` option to provide an interactive log viewing experience.

4. That's it! Now, every time you open a pull request, Stoat will host the Kubernetes logs and post a comment with a link to the preview. See an example in [this pull request](https://github.com/stoat-dev/kubernetes-log-export-action/pull/1).
