# For DevOps Engineers

Are you:
* Creating build tooling that needs to show results to users in GitHub comments?
* Helping your users manage and run many integration tests?
* Experiencing noisy comment spam in pull requests for all of your tools?
* Running into problems where orchestrating many GitHub actions results in fragile build systems?
* Trying to prevent build times from drifting longer and longer over time?

If the answer to any of these questions is true, Stoat might be able to help you.

Stoat makes it trivial to aggregate and access any build-related output in a single Stoat GitHub comment that is updated by the Stoat GitHub application.
This means you can use a single comment to collect output from multiple tools.
Stoat handles all the race conditions and edge cases.
All you have to do is push files or other data to Stoat and Stoat maintains the external state necessary to aggregate this data into a single comment.
This comment uses Handlebars templates and is fully customizable.

Stoat also tracks metrics around build runtime (and in the future will allow tracking custom metrics).

Here's a screenshot from an [example pull request](https://github.com/stoat-dev/example-java/pull/1) that shows Stoat updating a build comment with build outputs:

In the near future, Stoat is also going to add support for running and managing integration tests.
If you're interested in becoming a design partner for this feature, we'd [love to talk to you](../company/contact-us).

We'd also [love to hear from you](../company/contact-us) about any challenges you see building out internal developer tools.
Stoat intends to become the platform for building developer tooling, so any feedback and ideas you have to share are very welcome!
