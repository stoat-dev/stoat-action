# For Java Engineers

A typical build for a Java project produces a number of useful reports:
* JUnit test results
* JaCoCo test coverage
* Checkstyle reports
* PMD violation reports
* Javadocs
* OpenAPI/Swagger API docs
* Build dependency reports
* ...and more!

Accessing these reports for a remote build on GitHub can be painful.
Even accessing a Gradle scan for your failed GitHub build can often take over a minute after scrolling through the logs for the link!
While you can try to address this by using a combination of GitHub actions to post some of these results to GitHub comments or zipping the output files and making them downloadable from the GitHub action page,
Stoat is the easiest way to make all of this information trivial to access.

Stoat hosts these outputs and makes them accessible with a single click in a GitHub comment:
<img src="https://stoat-dev--static.stoat.page/screenshot-java.png" alt="java comment screenshot" width={600} />

<br /><br />

The comment can also track build times and other metrics. Additionally, the comment is fully customizable, so
you can choose what to display and how it should appear in the comment.
Visit our [templating documentation](../concepts/templating) for more information about customization.

## Example Repo

See a real build that generates and links to Java build reports in [this pull request](https://github.com/stoat-dev/example-java/pull/1).

Enabling and finding the paths to HTML reports is often the hardest part about setting up Stoat.
The [example-java source code](https://github.com/stoat-dev/example-java) contains examples of setting up quite a few
HTML test reports using Gradle and can be used as a reference.

## Relevant Tutorials
